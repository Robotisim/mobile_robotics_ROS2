Organization: Robotisim

This launch file initiates a Gazebo simulation in a specified world and spawns four TurtleBot3 models at distinct locations.

Arguments used:
- world: Full path to the Gazebo world file to load.
- x_pos: The x-coordinate where the TurtleBot3 model should be spawned in the Gazebo world.
- y_pos: The y-coordinate where the TurtleBot3 model should be spawned in the Gazebo world.
- yaw_rot: The yaw rotation of the TurtleBot3 model when it is spawned.
- robot_name: The name of the TurtleBot3 model to be spawned.
- robot_ns: The namespace into which the TurtleBot3 model should be spawned.

Packages used:
- gazebo_ros: This package provides nodes and plugins necessary to run, interface and interact with Gazebo simulations from ROS2. In this launch file, it is used to start the Gazebo server and client.
- turtlebot3_gazebo: This package contains the Gazebo simulation environments for TurtleBot3. In this launch file, it is used to retrieve the path of the Gazebo world file.
- drive_tb3: This is a custom package that is likely to contain launch files and nodes necessary to control the TurtleBot3 models. In this launch file, it is used to spawn the TurtleBot3 models at specified locations in the Gazebo simulation.
